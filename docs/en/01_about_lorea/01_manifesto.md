title: Our manifesto
-----
 
### var lorea = (n-1)^(n-1);

Expanding the offensive means to radicalize the insubordination to any level to exercise our destructive creativity against the society of spectacle, sabotage the goods that sabotage our lives, to meet in assemblies, to choose delegates always revocable by the base, to connect all the sites of struggle not to neglect any of the technical resources useful for liberated communication, to give a direct exchange value to everything that has an exchange value and organize the self-defense of the conquered territories... 


### ((o))

Available to everyone will be a general scientific education, especially the learning of the scientific method, the habit of correct thinking, the ability to generalize from facts and make more or less correct deductions. But of encyclopedic minds and advanced sociologists there will be very few. It would be sad for mankind if at any time theoretical speculation became the only source of guidance for society, if science alone were in charge of all social administration. Life would wither, and human society would turn into a voiceless and servile herd. The domination o f life by science can have no other result than the brutalization of mankind.

### .:():.

We are the advocates of education for all the people, of the emancipation and the widest possible expansion of social life. Therefore we are the enemies of the State and all forms of the statist principle. In opposition to the metaphysicians, the positivists, and all the worshippers of science, we declare that natural and social life always comes before theory, which is only one of its manifestations but never its creator. From out of its own inexhaustible depths, society develops through a series of events, but not by thought alone. Theory is always created by life, but never creates it; like mile-posts and road signs, it only indicates the direction and the different stages of lifeâ€™s independent and unique development.

### :*:

Our program can be summed up in a few words: Peace, emancipation, and the happiness of the oppressed. War upon all oppressors and all despoilers. Full restitution to workers: all the capital, the factories, and all instruments of work and raw materials to go to the associations, and the land to those who cultivate it with their own hands. Liberty, justice, and fraternity in regard to all human beings upon the earth. Equality for all. To all, with no distinction whatever, all the means of development, education, and upbringing, and the equal possibility of living while working.

For years, months, days, we networks and communities of individuals have been exchanging knowledge, designing worlds, experimenting with gizmos and devices. We are the expression of a thousand thoughts, we are migrants across the City and the Net; we are searching for a place where our commonalities and practices can open up space-time discontinuities. We want to hack reality, and we need a lab to reassemble its basic elements. In a metropolis scared by unreal securities and too real fears, we yearn to give birth to a site of full of imageries made flesh, of bytes resurrecting metal. Our collective mind is replete with digital/analog technology, info-communication, knowledge-sharing, meme-spreading, participation-catalysis, and much much more. The four cardinal points are no longer sufficient coordinates. As Mars is closer to Earth than ever in history, there is no better time for a new reticular constellation, for a new geometry of relations that can freely recompile low-entropy bioware, stunning and getting stunned by vivid special effects and lively affects.

On the picture of the universe, we shared the same pixel. we travelled together through this space at 30 kilometers per second, blazing stars leaving behind.. we even tried to spot them, under the light dome and cloudy cover of some -by now unknown- coordinates for space, time and consciousness. Having previously conquered space and time, just one axis left to be done. How did we know it was possible?, because we had previously dreamt it so many times, in our nightmares as well as our illussions. Having had something in the water, we could no longer think or act consciously, pre-meditatingly, we would just despair for minutes hours or ages trying to find the lost point of some conclussion, because there must have been one. Still, we couldn't remember any more, or did we but we forgot the question? Wandering endlessly ... everyday a little bit slower due to gravitational pull, but making up for it with the beating of our hearts and sound systems... just pretending to go faster and faster! I fought daemons, ghosts and dreams, with you, again and again, we fought minds and sigils. We fought ourselves until being left crying, empty and utterly destroyed, we talked and talked for hours, like a tree in a thunderstorm, sturdy and untouched, while other branches would be still spinning around the same thoughts and ideas we left behind so long ago. After a few big shots, binaural beats, attaining body control, then breath control, then thought control, after a few more of those, we would act like a sofisticated and properly greased machine. Global consciousness. Started taking hold, as every time we made questions we sent electrical signals, global control therapy started to become useless, as we would be doing it anyways, corporations and mercenaries, why not, neurons and synapses, drugs sending amplyfied signals through this corrupted circuit, we can't handle it any more, but we do it with more and more enthusiasm. For hydrogen and helium, for charm and strange and the four forces, am i happy to be doing this

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

"The world began to change so much deeper than they might modify energy comets and geological forces. Soon arose on the planet who completed new chemical factories completely alter the landscape and atmosphere."

Also here there must be corruption and distortion, but I prefer swimming in the cacophony of a million contradictory voices than drowning in the quite and plausible lies from the genocidal authors of history who control the Hazzard machines.

I have no confidence in the future, the future is chaos. I have every confidence in the future, the future is chaos. 

Nihil sine kaos.
